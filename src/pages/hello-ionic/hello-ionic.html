  <h3>Welcome to your first Ionic app!</h3>

  <p>
    This setup guide will walk you through the steps to create your self trial. A self trial helps
    you decide whether certain food affects your symptoms.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the trial, you will be asked to eat your trial food on some mornings and to avoid that food
    on other mornings.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will help you track your progress and symptom levels by sending you daily reminders.
